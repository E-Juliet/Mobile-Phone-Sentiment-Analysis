# Business Understanding
Purchasing a product is an interaction between two entities, consumers and business owners. Consumers often use reviews to make decisions about what products to buy, while businesses, on the other hand, not only want to sell their products but also want to receive feedback in terms of consumer reviews. Consumer reviews about purchased products shared on the internet have a great impact. Human nature is generally structured to make decisions based on analyzing and getting the benefit of other consumer experience and opinions because others often have a great influence on our beliefs, behaviors, perception of reality, and the choices we make. Hence, we ask others for their feedback whenever we are deciding on doing something. Additionally, this fact applies not only to consumers but also to organizations and institutions.

As social media networks have evolved, so have the ways that consumers express their opinions and feelings. With the vast amount of data now available online, it has become a challenge to extract useful information from it all. Sentiment analysis has emerged as a way to predict the polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) of consumer opinion, which can help consumers better understand the textual data.
## Problem statement
E-commerce websites have increased in popularity to the point where consumers rely on them for buying and selling. These websites give consumers the ability to write comments about different products and services, which has resulted in a huge amount of reviews becoming available. Consequently, the need to analyze these reviews to understand consumers’ feedback has increased for both vendors and consumers. However, it is difficult to read all the feedback for a particular item, especially for popular items with many comments.

In this research, we attempt to built a predictor for consumers’ satisfaction on mobile phone products based on the reviews. We also attempted to understand the factors that contribute to classifying reviews as positive, negative or neutral (based on important or most frequent words). This is believed to help companies improve their products and also help potential buyers make better decisions when buying products.

## Main Objective
* To perform a sentiment analysis of mobile phone reviews from Amazon website to determine how these reviews help consumers to have conﬁdence that they have made the right decision about their purchases.

## Specific Objectives
* To help companies understand their consumers’ feedback to maintain their products/services or enhance them.
* To provide insights to companies in curating offers on speciﬁc products to increase their proﬁts and customer satisfaction.
* To understand the factors that contribute to classifying reviews as positive, negative or neutral (based on important or most frequent words).
* To determine mobile phones key features that influence smartphone purchases.
* To advise the advertisement department in companies on these key features to use as selling points and to specific customer segments in upcoming advertisements.

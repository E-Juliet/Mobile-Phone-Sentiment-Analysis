## Problem statement
E-commerce websites have increased in popularity to the point where consumers rely on them for buying and selling. These websites give consumers the ability to write comments about different products and services, which has resulted in a huge amount of reviews becoming available. Consequently, the need to analyze these reviews to understand consumers’ feedback has increased for both vendors and consumers. However, it is difficult to read all the feedback for a particular item, especially for popular items with many comments.

In this research, we attempt to built a predictor for consumers’ satisfaction on mobile phone products based on the reviews. We also attempted to understand the factors that contribute to classifying reviews as positive, negative or neutral (based on important or most frequent words). This is believed to help companies improve their products and also help potential buyers make better decisions when buying products.

## Main Objective
* To perform a sentiment analysis of mobile phone reviews from Amazon website to determine how these reviews help consumers to have conﬁdence that they have made the right decision about their purchases.

## Specific Objectives
* To help companies understand their consumers’ feedback to maintain their products/services or enhance them.
* To provide insights to companies in curating offers on speciﬁc products to increase their proﬁts and customer satisfaction.
* To understand the factors that contribute to classifying reviews as positive, negative or neutral (based on important or most frequent words).
* To determine mobile phones key features that influence smartphone purchases.
* To advise the advertisement department in companies on these key features to use as selling points and to specific customer segments in upcoming advertisements.
